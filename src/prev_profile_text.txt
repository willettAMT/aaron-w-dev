Software engineer with experience creating developer-friendly products that improve efficiency of systems.<br>
My current pathway is targeting IoT + AI and the application within different industries. <br>
I am interested in secure data-aggregation at the hardware level, the research and development of <br>
DL models interpreting the raw data, securing wireless protocols, and the cloud infrastructure for optimizing device UX.<br><br>

Previously, I worked on an open source product, Svelvet, as a software engineer, where I conceptualized and developed a <br>
component library for building flow-charts on the Svelte compiler. <br>
