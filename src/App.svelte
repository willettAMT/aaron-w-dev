  <h1>aaron willett</h1>
 
    <p>Software engineer with experience creating developer-friendly products that improve efficiency of systems.<br>
       My current pathway is targeting IoT + AI and the application within different industries. <br>
       I am interested in secure data-aggregation at the hardware level, the research and development of <br>
       DL models interpreting the raw data, securing wireless protocols, and the cloud infrastructure for optimizing device UX.<br><br>

       Previously, I worked on an open source product, Svelvet, as a software engineer, where I conceptualized and developed a <br>
       component library for building flow-charts on the Svelte compiler. <br>
