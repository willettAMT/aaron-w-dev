    <p>I am a software engineer passionate about building efficient, developer-friendly systems. My current focus is on IoT,<br>
        embedded systems, and low-level programming, with a keen interest in tackling the "30 million line problem" as <br>
        described by Casey Muratori. I explore ways to make software more maintainable, performant, and secure<br>
        — especially in resource-constrained environments.<br><br>
        My current coursework includes embedded C, NASM, embedded rust, malware reverse engineering, and web and cloud security.<br>
        I also contribute to firmware development with the Portland State Aerospace Society. My interests span secure data<br>
        aggregation at the hardware level, securing wireless protocols, and optimizing system efficiency from the ground up.<br>
        If you’d like to chat about systems programming, embedded security, or anything tech-related, feel free to reach out!<br><br>

        Previously, I worked on an open source product, Svelvet, as a software engineer, where I conceptualized and developed a <br>
        component library for building flow-charts on the Svelte compiler. Check out our documentation page <a href="https://svelvet.io" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><i>Svelvet</i></a> for the playground!<br>
