Software engineer with experience creating developer-friendly products that improve efficiency of systems.
My current pathway is targeting IoT + AI and the application within different industries. 
I am interested in secure data-aggregation at the hardware level, the research and development of 
DL models interpreting the raw data, securing wireless protocols, and the cloud infrastructure for optimizing device UX.

Previously, I worked on an open source product, Svelvet, as a software engineer, where I conceptualized and developed a 
component library for building flow-charts on the Svelte compiler.
